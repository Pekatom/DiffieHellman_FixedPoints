This repository is for working with Diffie-Hellman (DH) permutations, their fixed points and vulnerable exponents of prime integers. This repository 
is accompanying the research paper "Fixed Points of Diffie-Hellman Permutations" by Sophia V. Breslavets.  

Currently, Vasily A. Dolgushev is the only contributor to this repository.
